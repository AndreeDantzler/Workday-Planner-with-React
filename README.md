# Workday-Planner-with-React

## Description

Welcome to the Workday-Planner!

I was tasked with creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day . This app should run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML, CSS and React.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to be able to reimplement a past project using React, so that I can work towards mastering this new and prominent JavaScript technology.

## Screenshots

The following image shows the web application:
